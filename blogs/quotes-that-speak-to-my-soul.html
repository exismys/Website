Tags: quotes, philosophy

<p>I have been coming across quotes all my life - in books, in cinema, everywhere. I encounter them on daily basis and shake them off like any other pervasive thing. But, sometimes you come across words that you just can't shake off. They open your mind to a new line of thinking and you are just so grateful to have encountered them because otherwise you would have missed the wonder and awe you are feeling right now.</p>

<p>So this is the place for those kind of words.</p>

  <p>“Try and imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up. What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born.”</p>
  <cite>— Alan Watts</cite>
